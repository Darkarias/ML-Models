## Overview
This repository contains two major problem sets demonstrating core Artificial Intelligence algorithms implemented from scratch — emphasizing algorithmic design, mathematical understanding, and performance evaluation.

| Problem Set | Focus Area | Implementation | Key Methods |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| **PS1** | Decision Trees for Clinical Data | `decision_tree_scratch.py` | Entropy, Gini Impurity, Recursive Tree-Building, Baseline Comparison |
| **PS2** | Genetic Algorithms for 0–1 Knapsack | `genome_ps2.py` | Tournament & Roulette Selection, Crossover, Mutation, Performance Analysis |

Each project includes complete source code, configuration files, and final reports with detailed experimentation and discussion.
